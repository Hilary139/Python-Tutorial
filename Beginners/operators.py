Python divides the operators in the following groups:

        Arithmetic operators
        Assignment operators
        Comparison operators
        Logical operators
        Identity operators
        Membership operators
        Bitwise operators

   Operator	       Name	       Example	
        +	     Addition	        x + y	
        -	    Subtraction     	x - y	
        *	   Multiplication	    x * y	
        /	      Division	        x / y	
        %	      Modulus           x % y	
        **	  Exponentiation	    x ** y	
        //	  Floor division	    x // y

 Operator      	                    Example   	 
==                Equal   	            x == y	
!=	            Not equal         	    x != y	
>	          Greater than	            x > y	
<	          Less than	                x < y
